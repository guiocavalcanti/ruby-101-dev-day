# String set

Develop a class that represents a string set, supporting set operations:

- Add string
- Checking if the set contains a specific string
- Remove string
- Number of strings in the set, Count
- Union of two sets
- Intersection of two sets.
- Clearing the set.
- Enumerating the set.
- A variant of this problem is to support case-insensitive strings.
